# Sorting Algorithm Comparison (Bubble Sort vs. Insertion Sort)
This Python code implements two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. It also includes functionality to generate a random list of numbers and measure the execution time of each sorting algorithm on the list.

## Features:

  -  Generates a random list of integers.
  -  Implements Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms.
  -  Measures and compares the execution time of each sorting algorithm.
